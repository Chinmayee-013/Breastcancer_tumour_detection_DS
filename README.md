# Breastcancer_tumour_detection_DS
This project focuses on developing a data science pipeline to classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on diagnostic measurements. The goal is to assist medical professionals in making accurate and timely decisions by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze breast cancer data.

Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers globally, and early detection is crucial to improve patient outcomes. This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models that classify breast tumors. The models aim to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features like radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, and other cellular characteristics.
